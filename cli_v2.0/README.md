# Speedtest to InfluxDB

[ORIGINAL SOURCE](https://github.com/aidengilmartin/speedtest-to-influxdb.git)

This is a small Python script that will continuously run the Speedtest CLI application by Ookla, reformat the data output and forward it on to an InfluxDB database.

You may want to do this so that you can track your internet connections consistency over time. Using Grafana you can view and explore this data easily.
